# Design Curator Cards

## Project Overview
This project presents three major design movements: Bauhaus, Swiss Style, and New Wave Typography. Each card explains the movement’s philosophy, visual characteristics, and influence on modern design.

## My Approach
I focused on clarity and structure in both writing and layout. Instead of overloading historical detail, I emphasized the conceptual differences between the movements and how they influence modern UI and typography.

## What I Learned
I realized Swiss Style is more than just minimal design — it is deeply rooted in grid systems and typographic discipline. I also learned that New Wave was not random or messy, but a deliberate reaction against strict modernist structure.
