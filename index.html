    <!-- Card 1: Bauhaus -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>Bauhaus</h2>

      <div class="card-body">
        <p>
          Bauhaus was a German design movement that focused on combining art, craft, and industry. Its philosophy centered around functionalism — the idea that design should serve a clear purpose. Visually, Bauhaus used primary colors like red, blue, and yellow along with geometric shapes such as circles and squares. The style feels bold but structured. Rather than decorative design, Bauhaus emphasized clarity and usefulness. Its influence can still be seen in modern UI layouts that prioritize simplicity and intentional structure.

    <!-- Card 2: Swiss Style -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>Swiss Style</h2>
      <p class="date-range">International Typographic Style · 1950s–1970s</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Swiss Style emerged in the 1950s and emphasized clarity, objectivity, and structure. It is known for its strict grid systems, strong typographic hierarchy, and use of sans-serif fonts like Helvetica. Designers prioritized legibility and neutrality over decoration. Layouts were carefully aligned, with generous white space and logical information flow. Many modern websites and app interfaces reflect Swiss principles, especially in structured layouts and clean typography. The movement focused less on expression and more on universal communication.</p>

    <!-- Card 3: Reaction (choose New Wave OR Grunge) -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>New Wave</h2>
      <p class="date-range">New Wave Typography  · Late 1970s-1980s</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>New Wave emerged in the late 1970s as a reaction against the strict rules of Swiss Style. While Swiss prioritized grid systems and strict alignment, New Wave designers intentionally disrupted structure. They layered text, played with spacing, and experimented with typographic expression. The movement embraced individuality and visual energy over rigid order. Although sometimes less legible, New Wave challenged the idea that design must always be neutral and structured. It helped shift design into a more expressive, postmodern direction.</p>
