## WHAT I ALREADY KNOW (OR THINK I KNOW)

```
Write bluntly. Wrong answers are fine. That is the point.
```

1. Bauhaus uses primary colors like red, blue , yellow and black, along with geometric shapes like circles, squares and triangles.
2. Swiss styles is known for clean grids, typography with organized layouts. 
3. i think UI design is influenced by swiss design, it kinda looks like the "default" style when starting to design a webpage.

## WHAT I DO NOT KNOW

```
What are you fuzzy on? What might be completely wrong?
Be honest. Uncertainty is data.
```

1. I dont know the deeper history of Bauhaus or Swiss style.
2. I dont know why Bauhous and swiss styles repeatedly uses the same colors and what their  siginificance is.
3. i dont know exactly what New Wave means but i have an idea.

## VOCABULARY I NEED BEFORE I CAN WRITE

1. Functionalism
2. Rationalism

Bauhaus (1919–1933)

Core Philosophy:
Design should unify art, craft, and industry. Form follows function. Emphasis on functional, rational design.

Visual Characteristics:
Geometric shapes (circles, squares, triangles), primary colors (red, blue, yellow), strong contrast, asymmetry.

Typography:
Simple, often sans-serif typefaces. Clean and modern.

Use of Grid:
Less rigid than Swiss, but structured composition and balance.

Legibility vs Expression:
Balanced — clarity mattered, but form experimentation was allowed.

Cultural Context:
Post–World War I Germany. Industrialization and modernism were shaping society.

Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (1950s–1970s)

Core Philosophy:
Clarity, objectivity, and universal communication.

Visual Characteristics:
Strict grid systems, minimal color palettes, strong alignment, heavy use of white space.

Typography:
Sans-serif fonts (Helvetica, Univers). Strong typographic hierarchy.

Use of Grid:
Highly structured grid systems.

Legibility vs Expression:
Legibility prioritized over decoration or emotion.

Cultural Context:
Post–World War II Europe. Desire for neutrality and international communication.

New Wave Typography (Reaction to Swiss)

Core Philosophy:
Break the rigid rules of Swiss design. Introduce expression and emotion.

Visual Characteristics:
Layered text, experimental layouts, distortion, overlapping elements.

Typography:
Mixed type styles, broken grids, varied spacing.

Use of Grid:
Disrupted or ignored traditional grid systems.

Legibility vs Expression:
Expression sometimes prioritized over strict legibility.

Cultural Context:
Late 1970s–1980s. Postmodern design movement reacting against modernist rigidity.\

I thought Bauhaus and Swiss Style were basically the same because they both look clean and minimal. I now understand that Bauhaus was more about combining art and industry, while Swiss Style was stricter about grids and structure.

I used to think Swiss Style just meant “simple design,” but I learned that it’s really defined by its use of grid systems and strong typography rules.

I didn’t realize that “Modernism” is a specific design movement, not just another word for modern-looking design.

## DECISIONS

| Decision | Your Answer |
|---|---|
| Card 3 movement | [New Wave / Grunge — pick one, say why] |
| Expert for critique | [Name — say why this expert for this card] |

I decided to focus more on visual characteristics and design structure rather than deep historical background, since this is a design focused assignment.

For Swiss Style, I will emphasize grid systems and typography because those directly connect to modern UI design.

I will frame New Wave as a reaction movement instead of treating it as its own isolated style.

## THINGS I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT

```
After research, what did you reverse on? If nothing, you were not
paying attention or you already knew everything. Pick one.
```

1.I originally thought Bauhaus and Swiss Style were almost the same because they both look clean and structured. After researching more, I realized their philosophies are different. Bauhaus focused on combining art and industry, while Swiss Style focused more on clarity and structured communication.

2.I used to think New Wave was just chaotic or messy design. Now I understand it was a deliberate reaction against Swiss rules, especially strict grid systems.
